## 🌍 Climate Risk Explorer: Interactive AI Forecasting

A Data Science & AI Hackathon Project in collaboration with the **UCL Statistical Department** and **PA Consulting**.

This is an **interactive web map** that allows users to select any location globally to view historical and **AI-forecasted** trends for **temperature** and **precipitation**. The core feature is an **AI-generated summary** that interprets the forecasts, pointing out specific, localized **future climate risks** (e.g., droughts, heatwaves, typhoons).
