--- REMOVED STYLES ---
- General body/h1/h2/h3 styles: These are handled by Tailwind's bg-dark-bg, text-light-text, and text-primary classes on the body/elements.
- All .dashboard-header, .search-container, #location-search, #search-button styles: These are fully managed by Tailwind utility classes in the HTML.
- Layouts like .dashboard-main, .graphs-grid: These are managed by max-w-7xl, mx-auto, and the grid utility classes in the HTML.
